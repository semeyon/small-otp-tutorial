# Otp

This is a source for the tutorial [BUILD YOUR OWN SMALL SCALE OTP](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gf0iq0bv0rcra70/build-your-own-small-scale-otp.pdf?dl=0) based on the talk [Claudio Ortolina â€“ Painlessly functional and concurrent: An introduction to Elixir](http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/102836446).

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `otp` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:otp, "~> 0.1.0"}]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/otp](https://hexdocs.pm/otp).
